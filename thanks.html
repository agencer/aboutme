          <h2>Debriefing Form for Participation in a Research Study Involving Incomplete Disclosure – New York University (IRB-FY2025-10304)</h2>
          <br>
          <p>Thank you for your participation in the survey conducted by New York University and the Istanbul Social Sciences Research Center. For the purposes of this study, it was important that you were not told certain information about the study up front. Now that your participation is complete, we are providing you with a full explanation of the study’s goals and procedures. Your time and effort are greatly appreciated.</p>
          <br>
          <p><strong>WHAT YOU SHOULD KNOW ABOUT THE STUDY:</strong> Earlier, the consent form described the purpose of this study as exploring how people evaluate information in everyday situations. While that is true, we intentionally withheld additional details to avoid biasing your responses. This study investigates how the complexity of policy bundles and limitations in access to critical information affect people’s ability to detect harmful elements in decision-making scenarios. Participants are randomly assigned to view different versions of a fictional workplace policy containing helpful and potentially harmful reforms. We examine whether larger bundles and reduced access to information make it harder for people to identify risks or oppose harmful decisions.</p>
          <p>This temporary lack of full disclosure was necessary to ensure your natural reactions. If you had known the study’s hypotheses in advance, your decisions and attention patterns might have changed, affecting the validity of our results. We apologize for the incomplete information and appreciate your understanding.</p>
          <br>
          <p><strong>CONFIDENTIALITY:</strong> The data you provided remains anonymous. The only identifying detail you may have shared was your email address if you chose to enter the raffle. Your email is stored in a separate, secure file and will be permanently deleted after the digital gift cards are distributed. Your survey responses are not linked to your email and cannot be used to identify you. All research data will be stored anonymously and may be used in future academic research, shared with other researchers, or placed in secure data repositories, without additional consent.</p>
          <br>
          <p><strong>RAFFLE:</strong> If you entered the raffle, the 400 TL digital gift card (redeemable at Amazon Türkiye or Migros) will be sent to the email you provided. Each participant had a 1-in-25 chance of winning, and winners will be notified within 4–6 weeks. Email addresses will be deleted permanently after prize distribution.</p>
          <br>
	<p><strong>RIGHT TO WITHDRAW YOUR DATA</strong></p>
	<p>Because you were not fully informed about the study during the consent process, you may choose to have your data excluded from the research analysis. Please indicate below:</p>
	<ul>
  		<li>☐ I give permission for my data to be included in the study.</li>
  		<li>☐ I do NOT give permission for my data to be included in the research analysis.</li>
	</ul>
